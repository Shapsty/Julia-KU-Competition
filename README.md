dude
Link to pdf: https://engr.ku.edu/sites/engr/files/documents/SELF/High%20School%20Design%202024%20Rules%20Packet.pdf
basic:
   users need to be able to specify input file (What is file format???)
   users will need to describe the data that they see
   create a UI.
   convert weather code to words??? -- im not sure if this is a requirement or if they are just mentioning weather codes in the instructions 

ExP(extra points) Small:
   compare data using weather API (could use the government API or Open Meteo)
       Do this by:
       allowing for long & lat input & Timeframe input (see examples on website)
ExP Medium:
    Create histogram
       use similar input requirements to Small
       No idea how to do this but im sure there is a library
Exp Large:
   Make representable via HTTP:
     make your program essentially an API where other programs can get info? or just use these methods to get info for your program?
